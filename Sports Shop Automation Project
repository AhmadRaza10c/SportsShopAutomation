Sports Shop Automation Project (n8n + AI Agent)

This project is a fully automated Sports Shop workflow built using n8n, Google Sheets, and an AI Agent (Gemini).
It demonstrates how customer form data can be processed, stored, and used to send personalized emails automatically.

Project Overview

This is my first complete project built on n8n.
The workflow is designed to automate customer communication for a sports shop from start to finish.

The system:

Collects customer data through a form

Stores the data in Google Sheets

Uses an AI Agent to generate unique emails

Sends emails automatically

Updates the email status in the sheet

This project is suitable for beginners and shows a real-world automation use case.

Workflow Steps
1. Form Submission

The customer submits a form containing:

Name

Email

Phone

Address

2. Data Storage

The submitted data is automatically saved in Google Sheets

The sheet contains predefined columns for each field

3. AI Agent Processing

An AI Agent (Gemini) is triggered

It generates a unique and personalized email based on the customer data

4. Email Sending

The generated email is sent to the customer automatically

5. Status Update

After the email is sent, the same row in Google Sheets is updated

A "Sent" status is added for tracking
